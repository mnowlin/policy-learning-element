# Introduction 

Information is not a scare resource for policymaking. Policy actors and policymaking institutions are bombarded with information from a variety of sources. As a result, attention to information, specifically the inability of actors or institutions to attend to all information, becomes the limiting factor for how information is translated into policy learning and, ultimately, to policy change. Individuals and institutions have limited capacity to process information and, as a result, information is processed in a disproportionate manner. Disproportionate information processing limits the policy learning that can occur from information that is potentially relevant. 

Attention to some information rather than other information in driven by several factors, including the beliefs, biases, and motivations of policy actors. Actors that are motivated for accuracy would likely process information differently than those motivated to reach or maintain a specific conclusion [@kundaCaseMotivatedReasoning1990; @druckmanEvidenceMotivatedReasoning2019]. Along similar lines, prior beliefs can shape how information is processed by leading policy actors to weight information based on accordance with beliefs [@nowlinPolicyLearningInformation2021]. In some instances policy actors may seek to limit attention to some problem indicators to avoid blame or for ideological reasons to limit government actions. For example, at a campaign rally in June 2020 President Trump discussing COVID testing noted, "When you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases ... So I said to my people, ‘Slow the testing down, please.’ They test and they test” [@frekingTrumpSuggestsUS2020]. In each of these instances the potential for policy learning is shaped by how information is processed and what information does, or does not, receive attention.  

In this chapter we examine information and policy learning in the broader context of policy making processes. Specifically, we draw on policy process theories, including the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) and Punctuated Equilibrium Theory (PET) to develop of model of policy learning and information initially introduced by @nowlinPolicyLearningInformation2021. Next, we discuss the information processing and learning model in the context of the policy-embedded learning framework [@zakiSystematicReviewPolicy2022] to illustrate how the model accounts for policy learning among policy actors at the micro and macro level. Additionally, by joining the learning and information processing model and the policy-embedded learning framework we can illustrate how learning embedded in institutions and issue contexts can generate several potential learning outcomes.  

# Learning and the Policy Process 

Several of the theories and frameworks of the policy process discuss policy learning at least implicitly. For example, within the Multiple Streams Approach, learning can occur in epistemic communities in the policy stream, through changes in indicators in the problem stream, and experimenting with various political strategies in the politics stream [@herwegMultipleStreamsFramework2023]. Additionally, learning may be part of the policy diffusion or transfer process as one government learns from another []. 

Among the various policy process theories and frameworks, the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) has the most developed conceptualization of policy learning. Within the ACF, policy-oriented learning is a cognitive process based in policy beliefs and belief change. Specifically, policy-oriented learning is "enduring alterations of thought or behavioral intentions that result from experience, and which are concerned with the attainment or revision of the precepts of the belief systems of individuals or of collectives" [@jenkins-smithDynamicsPolicyOrientedLearning1993, 42]. With this definition learning includes changes in _thought_ and _behavior_ that result from changes in the _belief systems_ of _individuals_ or _collectives_. 

Early work using the ACF noted that changes in the "distributions of beliefs" result from several processes including, 

> 1) individual learning and attitude change, 2) the diffusion of new beliefs and attitudes among individuals, 3) turnover in individuals within any collectivity, 4) group dynamics, such as the polarization of homogenous groups or groups in conflict, and 5) rules for aggregating preferences and for promoting (or impeding) communication among individuals [@jenkins-smithDynamicsPolicyOrientedLearning1993, 42].

The majority of work regarding policy-oriented learning has focused on the first process; individual learning and attitude (i.e., belief) change. However, ACF scholarship has also noted that belief reinforcement can be a type of, or an outcome  of policy-oriented learning [@pattisonFactorsShapingPolicy2018]. In fact, belief reinforcement is likely the most common kind of policy learning [@weibleAdvocacyCoalitionsBeliefs2022]. Recent work has proposed that policy learning as change and reinforcement can be explained when policy beliefs are understood as a probability distribution with a central tendency (the belief) and variance (uncertainty about the belief) [@nowlinPolicyBeliefsBelief2024]. With this approach, learning as belief change occurs when there is a shift in the central tendency and learning as belief reinforcement occurs when there is a reduction in variance. More broadly, using this approach policy-oriented learning outcomes include no change in beliefs (i.e., no learning), belief reinforcement (i.e., a reduction in uncertainty), belief change (i.e., learning, or a significant shift in the central tendency), or belief change and reinforcement (i.e., a shift in beliefs and a reduction of uncertainty) [@nowlinPolicyBeliefsBelief2024].  

<!-- more about context of learning forums; deliberation -->
Learning in the ACF is largely based on individual-level cognitive processes; however, policy learning typically occurs in a collective context [@gerlakBuildingTheoryLearning2011; @heikkilaBuildingConceptualApproach2013]. An important collective context for learning is the nature of the policy subsystem in which policy actors engage. Subsystems are the key unit of analysis within the ACF, and they can vary on several key dimensions. As noted by @weibleExpertBasedInformationPolicy2008, subsystems can be unitary, collaborative, or adversarial. Unity subsystems involve one dominant coalition and a single understanding of the policy issue. Policy-oriented learning in unitary subsystems happens within the dominant coalition, and is likely belief reinforcement [@weibleExpertBasedInformationPolicy2008]. Additionally, in unitary subsystems policy-oriented learning as belief change is likely impeded by the status-quo bias of the dominant coalition and the negative feedback that is exerted regarding new information [@jonesPoliticsAttentionHow2005]. Collaborative subsystems involve cooperative coalitions with a shared understanding of the policy issue and learning as both belief change and belief reinforcement may occur within and across coalitions. Finally, adversarial subsystems include two or more coalition competing for policy influence with a debated understanding of the policy issue. Given that beliefs are contested in adversarial subsystems, belief reinforcement within coalitions is the most likely policy-oriented learning in an adversarial subsystem.  

More broadly, collective learning can be understood as: 

> 1) a "collective process", which may include acquiring information through diverse actions (e.g. trial and error), assessing or translating information, and disseminating knowledge or opportunities across individuals in a collective, and 2) "collective products" that emerge from the process, such as new shared ideas, strategies, rules, or policies [@gerlakBuildingTheoryLearning2011, 623]. 

With this definition, learning is a _process_ that results in one or more _products_. The process of learning involves the, "(i) acquisition; (ii) translation; and (iii) dissemination of knowledge, information, and experience" [@heikkilaBuildingConceptualApproach2013, 487]. Learning products are cognitive such as changed or reinforced beliefs and behavioral, including new strategies and policy change [@heikkilaBuildingConceptualApproach2013]. In the next section, we focus on the process of learning, specifically the role of information and information processing.  

# Information Processing 

The work on information processing in public policy has been developed by scholars using the Punctuated Equilibrium Theory (PET) of the policy process [@baumgartnerPoliticsInformationProblem2015; @baumgartnerPunctuatedEquilibriumTheory2023; @jonesPoliticsAttentionHow2005; @jonesThereHerePunctuated2012; @baumgartnerAgendasInstabilityAmerican1993]. PET explains policy processes that involve periods of stability and incremental change coupled with periods of large, rapid, and punctuated change. In brief, PET posits that stability and incremental change are a product of issues being contained within a subsystem, and punctuations occur as issues move from a subsystem to the macro-institutions of policymaking through positive feedback, changing policy images, shifting policy venues, and/or new policy actors becoming engaged. PET has expanded to incorporate information processing and attention of political systems and policy actors. 

Information and the prioritization and processing of information are key to the policy process [@workmanInformationProcessingPolicy2009]. In the information processing approach, information is understood as “signals of change” that emanate from the environment, and information processing is the “collecting, assembling, interpreting, and prioritizing” of those signals [@jonesPoliticsAttentionHow2005, 7].  Information signals that flow into the policymaking system vary but can be categorized as belong to one of the streams identified by the Multiple Stream Approach, including information about the problem, possible policy approaches, and the politics surrounding the issue [@nowlinEnvironmentalPolicymakingEra2019]. Information processing involves processing information signals; however, given that the supply of information possibly relevant for policymaking is large, neither individuals nor institutions can adequately process the vast number of information signals they receive. This dynamic leads to disproportionate information processing, where some signals are overemphasized, and others are ignored. Eventually, information signals that have been ignored accumulate and lead to punctuated policy change.

As noted, the process of learning involves acquisition, translation, and dissemination of information [@heikkilaBuildingConceptualApproach2013], and along similar lines @jonesPoliticsAttentionHow2005 argue that information processing involves four stages including a recognition stage, a characterization stage, an alternative stage, and a choice stage. The learning processes occur in similar ways at both the individual and the collective level. 

The acquisition stage involves the acquiring of information by individuals, which may happen through experience, observation, search, and/or deliberation [@heikkilaBuildingConceptualApproach2013]. Similarly, the recognition stage involves the allocation of attention to particular policy problems and information signals. The recognition stage translates to agenda setting at the collective level. For learning through information processing to occur, information must first be acquired and attended to. 

Next, information is translated or interpreted through concerted effort and analysis or through unintentional processes that are influenced by framing or the heuristics of the individual [@heikkilaBuildingConceptualApproach2013; @heikkilaDiagnosingIndividualBarriers2023]. For @jonesPoliticsAttentionHow2005, the next stage is the characterization stage, where the various attributes or dimensions of the problem are considered. Most policy issues are complex and can be understood and defined in a vary of different ways and the characterization stage involves policy actors assembling and weighting the various dimensions of the issue to develop the issue definition [@nowlinModelingIssueDefinitions2016]. 

Following from the characterization stage is the alternative stage, where policy alternatives are developed. As with the characterization stage, the alternative stage is multidimensional and several possible policy alternative are available. The understanding and definition of the problem constitutes a multidimensional problem space and the policy alternatives are a multidimensional solution space [@baumgartnerPoliticsInformationProblem2015]. Often, the dimensions of the issues weighted heavily in the construction of the problem space imply particular approaches in the solution space. Different types of information is needed to construct the problem space versus the solution space. Additionally, these spaces can evolve independently, much like the problem and policy streams [@kingdonAgendasAlternativesPublic1984; @herwegMultipleStreamsFramework2023]. When considering which problems to prioritize it is best to get information from a diverse array of source to develop a better understanding of the problem. This type of information is termed _entropic_ [@baumgartnerPoliticsInformationProblem2015]. Institutional structures that are decentralized can facilitate this type of learning [@eppStructurePolicyChange2018; @heikkilaBuildingConceptualApproach2013]. However, when considering how to address problems, it is best to rely on expert information. 

For @heikkilaBuildingConceptualApproach2013, the final part of the learning process is dissemination, where individuals share knowledge within a collective. Shared collective routines, communication practices, and deliberation may help facilitate the dissemination of information. Additionally, @heikkilaBuildingConceptualApproach2013 note that dissemination may inform the agenda-setting process, and can therefore play into the recognition stage. The final stage for @jonesPoliticsAttentionHow2005 is the choice stage, where a policy alternative from the solution space is selected for support by an individual or selected as a policy by a policymaking institution. However, we consider choice to be a product of the learning process. In the next section we discuss our model of information processing and policy learning.
