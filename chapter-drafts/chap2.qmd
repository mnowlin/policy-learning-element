# Introduction 

In this chapter we examine information and policy learning in the broader context of policy making processes. Specifically, we draw on policy process theories, including the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) and Punctuated Equilibrium Theory (PET) to develop of model of policy learning and information initially introduced by @nowlinPolicyLearningInformation2021. Next, we discuss the information processing and learning model in the context of the policy-embedded learning framework [@zakiSystematicReviewPolicy2022] to illustrate how the model accounts for policy learning among policy actors at the micro and macro level. Additionally, by joining the learning and information processing model and the policy-embedded learning framework we can illustrate learning embedded in institutions and issue contexts can generate several potential learning outcomes.  

# Learning and the Policy Process 

Several of the theories and frameworks of the policy process discuss policy learning at least implicitly. For example, within the Multiple Streams Approach, learning can occur in epistemic communities in the policy stream, through changes in indicators in the problem stream, and experimenting with various political strategies in the politics stream [@herwegMultipleStreamsFramework2023]. 

Among the various policy process theories and frameworks, the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) has the most developed conceptualization of policy learning. Within the ACF, policy-oriented learning is a cognitive process based in policy beliefs and belief change. Specifically, policy-oriented learning is "enduring alterations of thought or behavioral intentions that result from experience, and which are concerned with the attainment or revision of the precepts of the belief systems of individuals or of collectives" [@jenkins-smithDynamicsPolicyOrientedLearning1993, 42]. With this definition learning includes changes in _thought_ and _behavior_ that result from changes in the _belief systems_ of _individuals_ or _collectives_. 

Early work using the ACF noted that changes in the "distributions of beliefs" result from several processes including, 

> 1) individual learning and attitude change, 2) the diffusion of new beliefs and attitudes among individuals, 3) turnover in individuals within any collectivity, 4) group dynamics, such as the polarization of homogenous groups or groups in conflict, and 5) rules for aggregating preferences and for promoting (or impeding) communication among individuals [@jenkins-smithDynamicsPolicyOrientedLearning1993, 42].

The majority of work regarding policy-oriented learning has focused on the first process; individual learning and attitude (i.e., belief) change. However, ACF scholarship has also noted that belief reinforcement can be a type of, or an outcome  of policy-oriented learning [@pattisonFactorsShapingPolicy2018]. In fact, belief reinforcement is likely the most common kind of policy learning [@weibleAdvocacyCoalitionsBeliefs2022]. Recent work has proposed that policy learning as change and reinforcement can be explained when policy beliefs are understood as a probability distribution with a central tendency (the belief) and variance (uncertainty about the belief) [@nowlinPolicyBeliefsBelief2024]. With this approach, learning as belief change occurs when there is a shift in the central tendency and learning as belief reinforcement occurs when there is a reduction in variance. More broadly, using this approach policy-oriented learning outcomes include no change in beliefs (i.e., no learning), belief reinforcement (i.e., a reduction in uncertainty), belief change (i.e., learning, or a significant shift in the central tendency), or belief change and reinforcement (i.e., a shift in beliefs and a reduction of uncertainty) [@nowlinPolicyBeliefsBelief2024].  

<!-- more about context of learning forums; deliberation -->
An important context for learning is the nature of the policy subsystem. Subsystems are the key unit of analysis within the ACF, and they can vary on several key dimensions. As noted by @weibleExpertBasedInformationPolicy2008, subsystems can be unitary, collaborative, or adversarial. Unity subsystems involve one dominant coalition and a single understanding of the policy issue. Policy-oriented learning in unitary subsystems happens within the dominant coalition, and is likely belief reinforcement [@weibleExpertBasedInformationPolicy2008]. Additionally, in unitary subsystems policy-oriented learning as belief change is likely impeded by the status-quo bias of the dominant coalition and the negative feedback that is exerted regarding new information [@jonesPoliticsAttentionHow2005]. Collaborative subsystems involve cooperative coalitions with a shared understanding of the policy issue and learning as both belief change and belief reinforcement may occur within and across coalitions. Finally, adversarial subsystems include two or more coalition competing for policy influence with a debated understanding of the policy issue. Given that beliefs are contested in adversarial subsystems, belief reinforcement within coalitions is the most likely policy-oriented learning in an adversarial subsystem.
